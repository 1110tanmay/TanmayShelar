Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Tanmay!
I'm a graduate student at the Arizona State University. Pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Software Engineer. 

I have a work experience of more than 3 years of professional experience. My most recent experience was at Zocdoc, where I worked as a Senior Integration Support Specialist. 

I am proficient in Java, Python, C++, C#, HTML, CSS, Javascript. I have professional experience of building scalable backend technologies capable of handeling large magnitude of traffic. I have built and tested Rest APIs, also managed and transformed data received from the clients. 

I truly believe, while software engineering is about building software and solving problems, it is also about designing.
