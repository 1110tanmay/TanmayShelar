Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Tanmay!
I'm a graduate student at Arizona State University, pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Software Engineering.

I bring over three years of professional experience, including my time at Zocdoc, where I worked as a Senior Integration Support Specialist and Team Lead. I built full-stack tools, automated critical workflows, and managed complex healthcare data systemsâ€”delivering solutions that improved performance and directly impacted revenue.

Currently, I'm working as a Software Developer on a funded research project alongside PhD students. We're developing a first-of-its-kind wearable application that estimates core body temperature using real-time heart rate data. I'm leading the design and development across both watchOS and Wear OS, building full-stack architecture, and ensuring all data is processed securely on-device for privacy.

Iâ€™m skilled in Java, Python, C++, C#, JavaScript, and more. Iâ€™ve built scalable backend systems, designed REST APIs, and worked with cloud services like AWS and Azure, as well as frameworks like React, Flask, and Node.js.

To me, software engineering is about more than writing codeâ€”it's about solving meaningful problems with thoughtful, efficient, and secure design.
